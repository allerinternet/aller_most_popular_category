An ugly plugin for Wordpress, to enable most popular when using Varnish and such software.

-- Small description of issue --
Varnish is a tool to cache pretty hard. This makes it impossible to enable most popular stuff,
since Varnish doesnt communicate with web- or mysql-server at all.

A simple solution is to use Google Analytics for general most popular stuff, but now we want
it for a specific category, and that category alone. There will be no mark on url, etc, so 
Google Analytics doesn't make it any more.

-- Install --
Copy content to aller-most-popular, inside wp-content/plugins/. Visit settings page in Wordpress
administration for further instructions.

If you use a custom place for your plugins, you will probably have to edit 
aller-most-popular-count.php.

-- Use --
A widget, and use of templates will soon be available, probably in a few days.


Please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions for improvement.
